    {
      "question": "Why is a honeypot considered a detection mechanism rather than a preventive mechanism?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it blocks all malicious traffic automatically",
        "b": "Because it detects and logs attacker interactions instead of stopping them directly",
        "c": "Because it encrypts all database queries",
        "d": "Because it replaces firewall systems"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Honeypots do not automatically block all attacks.",
        "b": "Correct. A honeypot focuses on detecting, monitoring, and logging malicious activity rather than directly preventing it.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Encryption is a preventive control.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Honeypots complement firewalls but do not replace them."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "moderate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best indicates a potential attacker interacting with the honeypot database?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Regular access to authorized production tables",
        "b": "Frequent queries on decoy sensitive tables",
        "c": "Scheduled maintenance scripts",
        "d": "Authorized administrator login"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Normal production activity is not suspicious.",
        "b": "Correct. Repeated or intentional access to decoy tables strongly indicates malicious intent.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Maintenance scripts are legitimate operations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Authorized access is not suspicious."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "moderate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of analyzing logs generated by the honeypot system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To permanently delete attacker data",
        "b": "To understand attacker techniques and improve security policies",
        "c": "To increase database storage",
        "d": "To automatically upgrade the database version"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Log analysis is for intelligence gathering, not deletion.",
        "b": "Correct. Logs help understand attack techniques and strengthen security mechanisms.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Storage capacity is unrelated.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Database upgrades are not handled by honeypot logs."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "What role do real-time alerts play in a database honeypot system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They slow down database performance",
        "b": "They notify administrators immediately about suspicious activity",
        "c": "They automatically shut down the entire system",
        "d": "They hide attacker activity from logs"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Alerts are not designed to affect performance negatively.",
        "b": "Correct. Real-time alerts provide immediate notification of suspicious behavior.",
        "c": "Incorrect. System shutdown is not the primary function.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Alerts work together with logging, not against it."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "moderate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which principle allows a honeypot to collect intelligence about attacker behavior?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Data replication",
        "b": "Network segmentation",
        "c": "Controlled deception",
        "d": "Data normalization"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Replication improves availability.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Segmentation isolates network areas.",
        "c": "Correct. Honeypots rely on controlled deception to observe attackers.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Normalization organizes database structure."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "moderate"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a honeypot complement traditional security mechanisms?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By replacing authentication systems",
        "b": "By acting as an additional monitoring layer for suspicious activity",
        "c": "By disabling firewall protections",
        "d": "By storing all real confidential data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Authentication systems remain necessary.",
        "b": "Correct. The honeypot adds an extra monitoring and detection layer.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Firewalls are still required.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Honeypots store fabricated data, not real confidential information."
