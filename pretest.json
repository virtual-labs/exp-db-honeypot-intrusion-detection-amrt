      "question": "What is the main objective of implementing a database honeypot in this experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To replace the main database system",
        "b": "To detect and monitor unauthorized access attempts",
        "c": "To increase database storage capacity",
        "d": "To improve query execution speed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The honeypot does not replace the production database.",
        "b": "Correct. The honeypot is implemented to detect and monitor unauthorized access attempts.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Storage capacity is not the purpose of a honeypot.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Performance improvement is not the objective."

      "question": "What is the purpose of creating decoy tables such as `users_decoy` and `credit_cards_decoy`?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To store actual user data",
        "b": "To test database backup systems",
        "c": "To attract attackers and detect suspicious activity",
        "d": "To provide public data access"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Decoy tables do not store real sensitive data.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Backup testing is not the purpose here.",
        "c": "Correct. Decoy tables act as traps to detect and log unauthorized interactions.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Honeypots are controlled systems, not public databases."

      "question": "Which of the following SQL operations on a decoy table is considered suspicious?",

        "a": "SELECT",
        "b": "UPDATE",
        "c": "DROP",
        "d": "All of the above"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. SELECT on a decoy table is suspicious but not the only one.",
        "b": "Incorrect. UPDATE on a decoy table is suspicious but not the only one.",
        "c": "Incorrect. DROP is suspicious but not the only one.",
        "d": "Correct. Any interaction such as SELECT, UPDATE, DROP, INSERT, DELETE, or ALTER is considered suspicious."

      "question": "What type of information is stored when suspicious activity is detected?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Timestamp and query details",
        "b": "Only the database size",
        "c": "Only the server name",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The system logs timestamp, action performed, and other relevant details.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Database size is not relevant to attack detection.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Server name alone is insufficient.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Password-only logging is not secure or sufficient."

        "a": "Incorrect. Load balancing distributes traffic.",
        "b": "Correct. A honeypot works on the principle of deception-based defense.",

        "d": "Incorrect. Network routing directs traffic paths."

    {
      "question": "Why is the honeypot database not used as a production system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it contains fake sensitive data",
        "b": "Because it cannot store data",
        "c": "Because it does not support SQL",
        "d": "Because it is publicly accessible"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The honeypot contains fabricated data and is meant only for detection and monitoring.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It can store data but is not meant for production use.",
        "c": "Incorrect. It supports SQL operations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It is a controlled environment, not public."
